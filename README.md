We will make comparisons regarding social inequality in South Africa between the period of Apartheid and now based on data with respect to crime rates among race, level of education, and level of income. The objective of this research is to observe the effectiveness of policy change over time after Apartheid and to come up with possible policy so as to elevate the quality of life.
